# Extra Challenges

### JS Events

- Create an annoying website that shows you some content but it pops out a div that covers the whole page width and height after `10 seconds of being in the web page`, the div says that I'm a winner for something. `The div should cover the whole website`, create a close button but when the user clicks on it instead of closing it's gonna pop out 2 more divs with more annoying ads.
