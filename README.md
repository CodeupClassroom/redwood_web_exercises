# Notes for HTML and CSS

* Sites to practice typing and shortcuts
    * typing club, typing IO, shortcut foo
* Working with files and directories
    * Directory / File
        * Hidden files start with a `.`
        * `pwd` Print working directory
        * `mkdir` Create directory
        * `cd` Change directory, moves to a specific directory

        * `ls` List files
        * `touch` Creates an empty file
        * `cat` Show the contents of a file
        * `rm` Delete files or directories
            * We'll add a flag `-r` recursive
                * `rm -r directory` If the directory has only empty directories or is empty itself
                * `rm -rf directory` If the directory or any inner directory has files
                * Repeat the same operation to the directories within the current directories
                * It implies some sort of repetition of the same process
                * directories are containers
* Git workflow
* HTML Overview
    * Elements are containers
        * Elements can have either more elements or text (text nodes)
    * Without errors vs Valid
